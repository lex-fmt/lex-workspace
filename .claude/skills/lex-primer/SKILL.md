  Primer for writing correct Lex documents. Use when:
  (1) Writing or generating .lex content
  (2) Understanding Lex syntax (it is NOT Markdown)
  (3) Reviewing whether a .lex file is syntactically correct
  (4) Converting content to Lex format

# Lex Document Primer

Lex is NOT Markdown. It uses indentation and conventions from publishing — no `#` headers, no `---` separators, no `**bold**`. If you write Markdown syntax in a .lex file, it will be treated as plain text.

## Core Principle

Structure = indentation (4 spaces per level). The only explicit syntax marker is `::` (for annotations/verbatim blocks). Everything else is determined by position, indentation, and punctuation patterns.

## The Six Elements

### 1. Paragraph (fallback)
Consecutive non-blank lines. If nothing else matches, it's a paragraph.

```
This is a paragraph.
It can span multiple lines.
```

### 2. Session (heading + content)
A title line, then a **blank line**, then **indented** content.

```
1. Introduction

    This paragraph is inside the "Introduction" session.

    1.1. Background

        Nested session with its own content.
```

- Title can have an ordered marker (`1.`, `a.`, `I.`) or be plain text
- The blank line after the title is MANDATORY (distinguishes from definition)
- Content MUST be indented relative to the title

### 3. Definition (term + immediate content)
A subject line ending with `:`, then **immediately** indented content (NO blank line).

```
HTTP Methods:
    GET retrieves resources.
    POST creates new resources.
```

- NO blank line between subject and content (that would make it a session)
- Content can include paragraphs, lists, and nested definitions
- Cannot contain sessions

### 4. List (2+ items after blank line)
Two or more list-item lines preceded by a blank line.

```
Some intro text.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

- Markers: `- ` (dash), `1. ` or `1) ` (numbered), `a. ` or `a) ` (alpha), `I. ` (roman)
- MUST have at least 2 items (single item = paragraph)
- MUST be preceded by a blank line (or document start)
- NO blank lines between items (blank line terminates the list)
- Marker style of first item defines the list style; mixing markers is allowed

### 5. Verbatim Block (raw content)
A subject line ending with `:`, optional blank line, indented raw content, and a closing `::` annotation.

```
Example code:

    fn main() {
        println!("Hello");
    }

:: rust ::
```

- Content is NOT parsed (preserves raw text exactly)
- Closing `:: label ::` annotation is mandatory
- Marker form (no content): just subject + closing annotation

### 6. Annotation (metadata)
Structured metadata using `::` markers.

```
:: note ::
:: warning status=open :: This needs review
:: aside ::
    Block content here.
    - Can include lists
::
```

Three forms:
- **Marker**: `:: label ::` (no content)
- **Single-line**: `:: label :: inline text`
- **Block**: `:: label ::` + newline + indented content + bare `::` closing

## Inline Formatting

```
*bold text*           — strong (NOT **double asterisk**)
_italic text_         — emphasis (NOT *single asterisk*)
`code`                — inline code
#math expression#     — math notation
[reference]           — reference/link
```

Reference types (determined by content):
- `[https://example.com]` — URL
- `[@doe2024]` — citation
- `[^note1]` — footnote (labeled)
- `[42]` — footnote (numbered)
- `[#2.1]` — session reference
- `[./path/to/file]` — file reference
- `[TK]` — placeholder (to come)

Escape with backslash: `\*not bold\*`, `\[not a link\]`

## Common Mistakes (Lex ≠ Markdown)

| Wrong (Markdown) | Right (Lex) |
|---|---|
| `# Heading` | `1. Heading` + blank line + indented content |
| `**bold**` | `*bold*` |
| `*italic*` | `_italic_` |
| `[text](url)` | `[url]` (or footnote pattern) |
| ` ```code``` ` | Subject line + indented code + `:: lang ::` |
| `---` separator | blank line |
| `> blockquote` | indented paragraph in a definition/session |

## Indentation Rules

- 1 level = 4 spaces (tabs converted to 4 spaces)
- Partial indentation (e.g., 6 spaces = 1 indent + 2 literal spaces) is tolerated
- Content must be indented deeper than its parent element
- Dedent returns to parent scope

## Parse Precedence

The parser tries elements in this order:
1. Verbatim block (has closing annotation)
2. Annotation (`::` markers)
3. List (blank line + 2+ items)
4. Definition (subject + immediate indent)
5. Session (title + blank line + indent)
6. Paragraph (everything else)
